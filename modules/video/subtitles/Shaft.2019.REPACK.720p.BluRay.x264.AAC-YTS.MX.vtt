00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.218
Now you wanna be quiet.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.554
Now, when I got you in front
of my motherfucking face,

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.887
and I'm asking you questions.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.596
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'm right here!

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:05.893
This is the fucking problem.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.350
You don't show me no fucking respect,
and you don't listen.

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.567
I say the same shit to you

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:13.689
over and over and over again
like I'm a motherfucking tape recorder!

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.949
Not to mention the fact that my
apartment smells like a fucking cow barn

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.076
because of all
your fucking leather jackets!

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.453
And what is this? Huh?

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.740
You're a grown-ass man.
Open a fucking checking account.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.499
Your name is Shaft, not Chase.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.877
Nigga, I'm not gonna
keep dealing with this shit.

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.378
Now, I done told you,

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.086
I don't know who the fuck
or what the fuck you think this is.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.259
And you know what?

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.922
You think this shit is fun for me?

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.716
You think I like hearing myself
repeat myself, repeat myself?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.759
Hello? Are you even listening to me?

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.220
'Course I am, baby.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.226
Come here.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.438
You wanna do me a favor?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.322
What?

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.952
Oh, fuck no! Fuck no!

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.453
Who the fuck do you think I am?

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:06.037
You think I'mma put my sanctified lips
on that tainted community dick?

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.253
What the fuck?

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.414
- Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.
- Where the fuck are you going?

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.458
- Just stay here. I'll be right back.
- No! Don't go!

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.482
Please don't go!

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.666
Shit!

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.171
Oh, shit!

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.583
- Shit!
- Motherfucker!

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.644
Fucking Gordito.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.152
Please don't!

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.580
Don't shoot! Please, please!

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.283
Girl, what's wrong with you?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.527
You were saying something
about my bank account?

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.793
What the fuck was that?

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.087
You said no one would hurt us here.
Not in Harlem!

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:43.380
It's not my fault, Maya.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.641
No! John, this is different!

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.145
I can't. I can't. I can't. I'm not...

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.710
I gotta get him away from all this.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.895
No. Maya, Maya...

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.268
I gotta get him away from you!

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.069
Maya, don't do this.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.356
<i>...led by cutting over $255 million...</i>

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.233
<i>O. J. Simpson has been...</i>

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.857
It's okay.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.968
<i>So y'all need to hide your kids,
hide your wife...</i>

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.488
Move!

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.469
No, thanks.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.965
- Drive safe!
- Let's go.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.139
Yeah.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.646
Oh. Seriously?

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.418
Watch out, dipshit!

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.149
Excuse me, sir,
but this is a pedestrian...

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.453
Yeah, yeah. Fucking millennials!

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.172
Seriously?

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.764
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.166
Boom. Gotcha.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.636
Yo, where the hell have you been, man?

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.798
I just got back, but we, uh,
we need to talk about some shit,

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:37.975
<i>so you down to hang?</i>

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.638
Oh, what, "hang" hang? Like, in person?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.131
<i>Hell yeah, I'm down.</i>

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.560
What's going on over there?

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.265
It's an ambulance.
I'm walking near the hospital.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.025
Hospital? You good?

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.797
- Do you mean am I using?
<i>- No.</i>

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:50.982
No, that's not what I said.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.676
I know you're looking out for me, man.
I appreciate that. Sorry.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.695
I'm actually just going
for a routine checkup

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.742
with your favorite doctor, in fact.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.744
- Who, Sasha?
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.539
Dang. Man, I bet she looks good
in scrubs.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.104
You know, I will tell her that
you've been thinking about that.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.415
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Don't... Don't do that.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.859
No, J, you know I wouldn't
do you like that. Come on, now.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.045
<i>And, plus, you're, like,
a badass FBI agent.</i>

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.529
She might actually give you a shot.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.045
Well, I'm not an "agent" agent, per se.
I'm a data analyst.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.930
<i>Data analyst? Please tell me
you don't tell anyone else that.</i>

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.511
Are you kidding me? Of course I do.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.005
Cyber's running shit around here.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.352
- Hey, Shaft.
- Uh...

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.638
- Conference room. Now.
- Um...

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:25.930
It's John, sir.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.473
Okay, I gotta go.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.818
Yeah, "run shit," huh?

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.587
<i>All right, everybody,
listen up.</i>

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.980
As expected, the White House

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.026
wants to ramp up cyber surveillance
on potential terrorist threats.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:42.038
Specifically, we're keeping an eye
on the Rashad Azzam Mosque in Harlem

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.285
and its cleric, Farik Bahar,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.706
who's drawn our attention with his
frequent trips to Afghanistan.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.168
Now, we are gonna need
a complete digital blackout.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.131
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.260
The last thing I need is that asshole
from Channel Eight News

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.012
spewing some bullshit story
about Islamophobia

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.760
running rampant through the Bureau.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.808
So heads on a swivel.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.513
Okay, who wants lead on this?

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.103
Anyone else?

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.733
Wait. Seriously? I can do this.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.189
No, you can't.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.312
Put me in the game, coach. I...

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.448
Listen, rookie,

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.096
this isn't some bullshit exercise
they give you at the Academy.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.401
This is the real world.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.946
There is a certain hierarchy here
you need to respect.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.855
Gotta give respect to get it.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.914
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
What'd you just say?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.857
- How the hell did you hear that?
- Listen, kid.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.624
I don't have time to deal
with the latest hotshot out of MIT

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:35.958
looking to flex his nuts.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.423
I am dealing
with daily terrorist threats,

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.929
the worst heroin epidemic
this city has ever seen,

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.842
and a seven-year-old daughter
who wants me to call her Frank.

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.179
You are a rookie.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.810
Know your fucking role.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.721
Pasternack, you run the show.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.014
Meeting dismissed.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.824
You want another?
Happy hour's almost up.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.867
Yeah, sure. Why not?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.791
Can't say no to a $16 wells.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.468
Are you, like, an FBI agent
or something?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.429
Yeah, well...

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:27.184
Uh, I'm actually more of a data analyst
rather than an "agent" agent.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:31.848
I'm kind of like a cybersecurity expert.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.649
Okay, she left.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:34.735
Hmm.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.691
Again, bro, if someone is asking you
if you're an FBI agent,

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.182
just say you're an FBI agent, man.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.426
- Good to see you.
- Hey, man.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.050
Okay? Especially if she looks like that.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.992
- I got you a little surprise.
- Sasha!

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.744
Oh, my God.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.405
- What's up?
- Hi.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.577
Oh, it's good to see you.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.687
Oh, you know, when I heard that
you guys were hanging out,

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.043
I had to invite myself.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.249
Of course.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.879
I mean, I can't even remember

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.423
the last time
the three of us were together.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.487
What do you guys want to drink?
Here, let me get something.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.511
Thank you.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.839
- I'll have a club soda.
- Can I get a whiskey, please?

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.009
I'm serious.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.535
What... What did you
have to leave town for?

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.891
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.725
I was setting up some, uh,
some stuff for, uh, my new business.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:12.898
New business?

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.433
Wait. He didn't tell you about
Brothers Watching Brothers?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.069
No.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.070
Yeah, damn.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:22.065
Uh, okay, so it's
this rehabilitation program

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.074
that, uh,
me and my Army buddies started.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.902
Basically, the idea is to help vets
who are coming back

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.448
who, uh, are going through the same shit
that I went through with addiction,

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.284
and so just sort of helping them out,
get them on their feet.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.794
Oh, shit. That's...

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.538
Yo, that's what's up.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:38.876
There's something else, too.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.277
Something else?

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.587
Like what?

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:45.889
Um...

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.432
Sorry, guys. Uh, I actually, I gotta go.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.601
- You gotta go?
- What?

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.305
I gotta go. Some work stuff popped up.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.123
You just said that you were
gonna tell us something.

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.981
Yeah, and I'll just text you about it
later in the week.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.710
I just... There's something I gotta do.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.111
Okay.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.897
Yo, Karim!

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:05.742
You good?

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.614
What? Yeah. No, I'm fine.
Get back in there.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.667
You said that you wanted to talk.
I figured we could just talk right now.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.656
Nah, man. No, that's, uh...

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.619
Um, I just want to say, uh, thank you.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.874
Thank you for always being there for me,
for always, you know, having my back.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.338
Yeah.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.515
So go in there. Go have fun.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.805
- All right. I'm out.
- Yeah.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.135
Wish me luck.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:52.241
Hey. Hey, Ma, what's up?

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.826
Hey, um...

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.659
You okay?

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:57.917
<i>Fine.</i>

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.959
Ma, hey, what's wrong?

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.544
<i>JJ...</i>

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.845
Um...

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.630
<i>They found Karim.</i>

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.173
<i>He's dead.</i>

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.437
Ready. Fire.

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.558
Ready. Fire.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.695
Center face.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.017
<i>I just can't believe
he was using again.</i>

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.890
<i>He wasn't. He was clean.</i>

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.646
<i>JJ, don't make any excuses
for him, okay?</i>

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:00.816
The police found him.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.975
I don't care how they found him.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.565
The light was back in his eyes.
You saw him.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.320
You examined him, for Christ's sakes!

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:10.866
Yeah, but my examination
doesn't negate what the police found.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:13.869
To them,
he's just another dead junkie vet.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.240
We need to find out
what really happened to him.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.749
Well, you're in the FBI, aren't you?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.414
All right, thanks.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.471
Hey, which of these is the...

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.224
Give it up!

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.261
Give me your wallet!

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.350
Give me your wallet! That's right.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.604
Yeah. I'll sit here all day.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:26.983
My spot.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.040
Maybe I can come over today
or tomorrow? It don't really matter.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.986
Hey, you lost, B?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.448
No. No, I'm just, uh... I'm chilling.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.863
Yo, you a cop?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.290
No.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.499
I'm an FBI agent.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.785
That's funny. You funny, B.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.794
But for real, where you work?

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.705
Like, the Apple Store? Or a Panera?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.215
Oh, wait! You one of them dudes

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.258
who make the fancy coffees
and shit, right?

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.845
A barista?

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.678
I knew it! You a bay-reesta!

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:59.387
Hey, yo, how you get the milk to turn
into that Cool Whip shit on top?

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.386
It takes years of practice.
All right, kid?

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.304
- Thanks for your help.
- Oh, crap.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.082
That's that fool they found laid up,
tweaking off of Manny's shit.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.521
Wait a minute. Who's Manny?

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.560
How you gonna ask me
something like that?

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:11.655
You think I'm a snitch?

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:12.897
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.986
Well, I am. For a price.

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.400
How much cash you got on you?

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.738
Are you...

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:20.574
I don't know actually, okay?

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.364
I usually use Apple Pay.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:23.995
Let's see, um...

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:25.794
My gosh.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:26.876
Manny runs this block.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.208
Anyone copping dope around here
gets it from him.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.839
That's his spot right there.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.049
Now move, bozo.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:36.972
Oh.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:38.306
Perfect.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.974
You owe me for it, man!
You owe me for that!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.788
- You ain't getting shit.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:43.893
Go! Get out!

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.850
What did you do?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.070
Oh. Hey. Excuse me, miss.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.244
$10.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.452
For what?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.203
$10, I'll suck your dick.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.448
For 5, I'll let you lick my titties.

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:08.957
No, those are reasonable prices, but...

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.337
But what, motherfucker?

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.507
What, you don't like titties?

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.589
No, I love titties.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.295
Titties are the best. Right?

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.085
I just had a big breakfast.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.116
I didn't really anticipate
licking titties today.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.450
The fuck are you doing here then?

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.761
Well, I'm here looking for somebody.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:23.935
Manny?

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.302
Somebody say my name?

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.233
Uh...

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.234
Yeah, Manny?

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:32.813
Name's Manuel.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.603
Only my friends call me Manny.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.773
And you and me,
we ain't friends, are we?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.486
No. No, we're not.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.902
No, we ain't friends?

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.404
No! Yeah!

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.993
Wait a minute. Hold on.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:49.376
See, I came here to ask you
about somebody who's a mutual friend.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.628
So that's gotta count
for something, right?

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:52.797
Here, I'mma just...

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:55.884
Come on, guys.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.964
Where the hell did he come from?

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.897
Come on now.
I'm just grabbing my cell phone.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.546
See? I just... Hold on.

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.465
I wanna show you something.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.350
Here, I'mma pull this picture up.

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:06.677
Shit, not that picture.

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.688
Hang on, give me, give me one second.
This is... This is dumb.

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.440
I hate this new update.
This shit is stupid.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.351
Uh, here. Okay, okay.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.817
Did he come in here?
Maybe last week, looking to...

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.034
you know, make a purchase from you?
Did he?

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.991
He didn't do that. No.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.224
No, that doesn't make sense at all.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.568
Look, I'mma just get out of here.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.909
You know, this is absolutely...

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.596
Ow.

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:45.970
Look, I'm just happy that you're okay

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.806
and that this didn't turn into
a shootout or something.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:52.019
It's kind of hard for it to escalate
into a shootout if you don't have a gun.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.606
You ain't got a gun. That's funny.

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.813
No, I'm not a gun guy.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.028
Not a gun guy?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.983
JJ, you're in the FBI.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.522
Even I have a gun.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.094
And I live in the nice part of Brooklyn.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.451
You know that most gunshot wounds
are self-inflicted?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.577
Statistically speaking,
you're safer without one.

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.114
Not when you're in a drug house
investigating a murder.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.577
Did you at least find anything?

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.369
Yeah, but it's... It's nothing good.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:16.756
All right.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.966
So I hacked into
the medical examiner's database,

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.549
and I pulled
the initial toxicology report.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.755
The cops might've been right.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.798
Looks like he OD'd.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.393
Wait a minute.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.769
There's no way that Karim
could've done this to himself.

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:32.999
The concentration levels are too high.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.980
He would've OD'd
before he even finished using.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.851
Who would do this to him?

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.277
Where are you going?

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.283
I gotta get Manny to talk.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.888
Karim's body was found
outside his place.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.912
He has to know something.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:50.698
You are not going back there.
Not without the police.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.242
Manny is not talking to the police.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.334
Okay, okay.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.247
So, if he won't talk to the police,
and he won't talk to you,

00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.665
then who is he gonna talk to?

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.384
Hello?

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.098
Oh.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.141
Um...

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:51.884
Hi. Uh...

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.474
I'm... I'm, I'm just...
I'm looking for... for...

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:55.647
Shaft?

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:57.899
Mmm-hmm.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.900
Is he here?

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.420
Right here, motherfucker.
Who's asking?

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:01.810
Oh, shit!

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.029
Um...

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.193
Um, it's me. It's... It's JJ.

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.366
JJ who?

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.986
JJ. John Shaft, Junior.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.446
- Your son.
- My son?

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.620
Son?

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.533
I thought you pulled out
on time every time.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:13.706
Shit.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Junior?

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.001
Yeah.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.163
Fuck you doing here?

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:22.331
Come on.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.877
What the fuck are you wearing?

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:41.228
I thought "Irresistible" was
some kind of stripper name or some shit.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.314
I looked at your driver's license,

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.773
and that shit's for real.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:47.021
- I'll call you.
- No, you won't.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.485
Yeah,

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:50.779
I will.

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.001
Hell of a Pilates teacher.

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.455
Do you want a drink?

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.173
I'm good.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.549
I can fix you a bubbly water
with a wedge of lime, if you'd like.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.804
It's 11:00 in the morning.

00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:14.557
Like, you aren't shaming me
by suggesting that me drinking water

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:16.059
would actually be a bad thing.

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:19.141
And as for that wedge of lime,
it makes it an alkaline, so...

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:24.067
Oh, my God.
Your mom has really fucked you up.

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.647
No, she just raised me.

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.904
She didn't abandon me 25 years ago.

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.860
Whoa, whoa. Pump your brakes, now.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.026
I did not abandon you.

00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.241
It's a little more complicated
than that.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.701
Oh, okay. Well, I didn't realize
that it was complicated.

00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:40.037
You know, in that case, all is forgiven.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.314
You're standing here,
acting like I ain't remember you.

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:44.024
Like I ain't send you shit
every birthday...

00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:45.768
Like the condoms you sent me
when I was ten?

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.959
You remember that year I sent you
those VIP passes to Honeybuns

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:51.628
with the complimentary $500 stacks?

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.431
No.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.515
Oh.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.348
Your mama didn't give you that, huh?

00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:59.682
She's scared you're gonna
run into your grandma up in there.

00:23:59.897 --> 00:24:01.729
You know she had
more stripper girlfriends

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.351
than an Arab got hoes in a harem.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:06.359
Could you not talk about my grandmother
like that, please?

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:10.321
Whoa. Whoa-ho.

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:13.984
So my blood is collecting checks
from the FBI?

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.037
That's right.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:17.538
Hmm.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.247
How does it feel
to be working for the Man?

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:22.249
You mean having an actual job?

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.785
Like, paying taxes,

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:27.673
not living off the grid
in an all-cash sublet?

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:28.841
It's great.

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:32.005
So you in the city now?

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:33.962
Don't tell me.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.927
Down in SoHo, exposed brick loft,

00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:40.469
with a bi-curious roommate,
a little furry-ass dog,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.061
and, uh,

00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:43.889
and a farmhouse sink.

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:45.602
You been stalking my Facebook?

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.416
I look like
I'm on Facebook, motherfucker?

00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.298
I mean, you come in here
with your skinny-ass jeans,

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.029
your button-down plaid Gap shirt,

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:55.567
and what looks like
some badminton fucking Nikes.

00:24:57.079 --> 00:25:00.572
Any nigga with two eyes and a dick
could read you a mile away.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:05.995
Oh, your mom did one hell of a job
turning you into a bona fide white boy.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:08.629
What, 'cause I shop at the Gap,
and I have a college degree,

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.290
and I know my FICO score,

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.548
that means I'm not black?

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:13.676
Well, it kind of does.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.198
You know what?
I'm not doing this with you.

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:17.214
I didn't come here to argue
about my clothes

00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:18.391
or where I work

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.850
or any of the father-son stuff
that you wanna talk about.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020
I'm here for business.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:25.555
And what kind of business could
your Don Lemon ass have in my world?

00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:29.900
I need your help.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.740
I knew it.

00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:36.820
I knew this day would come.

00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:41.159
No matter how hard your mom tried
to kill that family shit in you,

00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:43.368
those Shaft swimmers found their way

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:45.099
all the way
up in that pussy, didn't they?

00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:47.172
Come on, how far along is she?
How much you need?

00:25:47.254 --> 00:25:48.995
No, there's no "she."

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:52.586
I need to hire you.
I need your help for a case.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:53.676
Oh.

00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:57.004
You can't afford me.

00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:58.181
You owe me.

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:01.759
Just consider it payback
for father figure deprivation.

00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:02.935
Nigga, what?

00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:04.264
Please don't use the N-word.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.846
Okay.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:08.439
What's the case?

00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:11.025
I think my best friend was murdered.

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:12.195
You think?

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:14.756
It was ruled as an overdose,
but I have reason to believe that...

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:15.967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.028
I have heard all this before.

00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:19.613
You've heard all of what before?

00:26:19.787 --> 00:26:24.031
Friends and families of junkies
always looking for some other reason

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.995
when a junkie is just a junkie.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:27.168
Case closed.

00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:29.453
You didn't know him. He was clean.

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:37.426
That overdose was bogus.

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.551
He had enough heroin in his system
to kill ten people.

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:44.263
There's no way he could've
done something like that to himself.

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:48.806
I traced the supplier to this run-down
tenement in Harlem on 139th Street.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.357
139th Street?

00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:53.859
You sure?

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.440
Yeah.

00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:56.989
Huh.

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.400
Well, that's interesting.

00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:06.406
Why is that interesting?

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.171
Who did that to you, son?

00:27:21.932 --> 00:27:23.423
Don't act like you care about that.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:28.512
You tell me who put hands on you
like you some little punk,

00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:30.021
and you tell me right now.

00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:35.522
All right, it's this henchman.

00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.403
This guy named Manuel.

00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:38.573
What?

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.445
One of Manny's push-up-doing punks
did that to you?

00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:43.452
Yep.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.239
That motherfucker
must've lost his goddamn mind.

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.032
Shit!

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:52.378
Uh, what are you doing?

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.791
Got to go handle our business. Come on.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:00.386
Hey. Uh...

00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:02.344
Where are we going?

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.632
Look, you either get in or get gone.
But if you get gone, you stay gone.

00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:32.830
Damn, man, how old is this car?

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.670
Yo!

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.173
Your clicker's not working. Come on!

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:49.908
What, you just gonna march
right in there?

00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.473
You said you wanted my help.

00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:53.567
Yeah, help finding out
who killed my best friend.

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.356
Not help getting my ass kicked again.

00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:57.938
Well, this is the streets, son.
What you expect me to do?

00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:00.327
I don't know.
I thought maybe you had his cell.

00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.321
We could send a tersely-worded text.

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.194
Oh, no, no, no. See, I'm anti-gun.

00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:06.288
There's a reason
I'm an analyst and not an agent.

00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:07.555
That some of your mama's shit?

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.619
No, it's some of your shit

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.987
that turned into my mama's shit
that turned into my shit.

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.291
I think.

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:14.532
That's some more of your mama's shit.
You think too much.

00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:18.872
You know what?
I think I'm gonna wait in the car.

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:20.881
That's what your mama would do.

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:30.390
Unbelievable.

00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:33.352
"Some of my mama's shit."

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:38.854
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:40.647
Fine!

00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:44.907
I'm sorry.

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.469
What did I tell you
about that last time, huh?

00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:57.038
The fuck you doing?

00:29:57.379 --> 00:30:00.588
My man, I'm supposed to be
meeting my real estate agent here,

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:04.171
but, you know,
the virtual tour she sent me,

00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:08.714
I could've sworn
this place had a lot more light.

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:11.470
What? Look, man,
I don't know what the fuck you...

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:20.524
Oh, my God! I thought
you was really gonna shoot him.

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:22.481
- Get their guns.
- Okay. Uh...

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.174
Yeah, I got it. I'mma be taking these.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.192
Now, which one of these motherfuckers
laid hands on you?

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:32.536
- That one.
- Him? Oh.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.979
- Shit! No, I pointed at the other one.
- Yeah, I know.

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:38.688
But since
you're gonna be whooping his ass,

00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:40.312
I wanted to make sure he didn't jump in.

00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.822
You are gonna whoop his ass, right?

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:42.965
Um...

00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:48.721
Aah!

00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:49.838
Where's Manny?

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.345
How is he supposed to answer?
You're crushing his nuts.

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:55.726
No. When I get leverage on the wall
and lean like this,

00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.303
I'm crushing his nuts.

00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:58.972
Where's Manny?

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.685
Yo, what the fuck is going...

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.725
- Manny!
- Shaft?

00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:04.735
<i>Qué pasa,</i> shitbag?

00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:06.489
What do you want?

00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.489
What do I want?

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:11.196
Wow. So long
since somebody asked me that.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.611
Oh, well, now that you ask,

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.702
I want cheap,
over-the-counter erectile cream.

00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:21.332
Uh, I want Jodeci and Al Green
to drop a Christmas album.

00:31:21.505 --> 00:31:24.873
I want 24 hours, uninterrupted,
with Halle Berry,

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.087
hence the erectile cream.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.593
But what I really want to know

00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:33.598
is why you didn't afford my son

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:38.512
the respect associated
with the Shaft family name?

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.430
That's your son?

00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:41.814
Pride and joy.

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:45.236
He's running?

00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:47.027
- Yeah.
- Shoot him.

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.342
Where are the guns you picked up?

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.153
Oh. Um, I threw those out the window.

00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:54.990
You don't throw guns out an open window!
Kids live up here!

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.041
Damn!

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:08.966
- Move!
- Hey!

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:16.058
Aah!

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.633
Gentrification's a bitch, ain't it?

00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:28.736
- Here, cover him.
- Uh...

00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:30.521
Take the gun!

00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:35.743
What the fuck? Aah!

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:38.706
Oh!

00:32:38.707 --> 00:32:41.370
Damn!
Yo, your pinkie just got fucked up!

00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:43.284
Show him the goddamn picture, will you?

00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:44.462
Oh.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.089
So my friend's body was found
outside your building last week.

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:50.819
So, what, was he buying drugs from you?

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:53.239
- Can't hear you!
- No, no, no. Okay. Look, look, look.

00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:54.907
I don't know what he was doing there,
all right?

00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:56.742
He used to cop from me,
but I ain't seen him in a while,

00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:59.606
ever since he was fucking with that
Brothers Watching Brothers bullshit.

00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:01.469
Brothers Watching Brothers?

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:04.086
Damn, son. Sounds like your boy
might've been on the down-low.

00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:06.272
Anything you wanna tell me?

00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:08.564
What? No!

00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:11.696
You sure? 'Cause that damn sure
would explain a whole lot of shit.

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:13.231
Yes, I'm sure.

00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:14.444
So you like pussy?

00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:16.951
Yes. I like... I like pussy, yeah.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.723
The way you say "pussy,"
it don't sound like you like it.

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.016
Describe what a pussy look like.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.372
It's got... It's...

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.328
No. You know what? Listen, man.

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:26.586
Brothers Watching Brothers
is a rehab center for Army vets.

00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:28.087
- For real?
- Yes.

00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:29.542
- For real?
- For real?

00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:31.091
Yes.

00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:34.589
- That all?
- Look, that's all I know, all right?

00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:35.879
All right, then.

00:33:36.806 --> 00:33:37.806
For real, though?

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.553
Them motherfuckers need a new name.

00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:42.205
See, Manny, that wasn't hard, was it?

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.765
You broke my whole fucking hand!

00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:45.851
I broke two fucking fingers!

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:49.563
This is me breaking
your whole fucking hand.

00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.881
Hate it when motherfuckers exaggerate.

00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.697
Oh. And you fucked up my coat.

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.983
That's gonna be $100 to get it cleaned.

00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:58.697
$100.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.707
Wow.

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.708
All right, then.

00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:07.962
We're good.

00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.329
Get in the fucking car.

00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.088
Holy...

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:26.971
Aggravated assault,

00:34:27.148 --> 00:34:29.140
illegal use of a firearm,

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.478
torture?

00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:35.238
You didn't just break laws.
You committed human rights violations.

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.524
So?

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.695
I work for the FBI.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:43.408
I can't be aiding and abetting
the city's highest-profile sociopath

00:34:43.582 --> 00:34:46.871
as he just tears through Harlem
one drug dealer at a time.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:49.706
Look, you asked for my help.
I gave you my help.

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.791
You don't like the way
the sausage is made,

00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:53.401
close your eyes when you're eating it.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.008
The fuck kind of metaphor is that?

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.136
I think what you're trying to say
is, "Thank you."

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:01.889
Yeah, right. Thanks.

00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:03.890
Can you drop me off, please?

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.052
I think coming to you was a mistake.

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:08.141
- I'll take it from here.
- Take what from here?

00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:11.149
I'm going to Brothers Watching Brothers,
see what I can find out.

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:12.354
Fuck that.

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.769
We are going
to Brothers Watching Brothers.

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.062
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we."

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:17.946
If you're gonna pursue
this investigation,

00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:19.444
I'mma have to babysit your ass.

00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:21.408
You're the worst father ever.

00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:23.240
No, that would be mine.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:26.743
But I can't have your ass out here
in these streets,

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.244
besmirching our family name.

00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:39.426
Hello.
Welcome to Brothers Watching Brothers.

00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.337
How can I help you?

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:42.514
Stop.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:44.555
Yes. Hi, um, we were actually
just hoping to talk...

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:45.726
Yo!

00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:48.140
Could whoever's in charge of
this motherfucker come up front?

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.513
Why do you... Really?

00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:53.734
Can I help y'all?

00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:55.234
Sorry about that. I'm JJ.

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:57.315
- This is...
- Shaft. John Shaft.

00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.943
Ignore him.
He thinks he's the black James Bond.

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:02.324
If that motherfucker was real,
he'd think he was me.

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:04.694
Please, stop.

00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:06.328
I'm Major Gary Cutworth.

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:09.138
We like to keep it a little casual
around here. Just call me Cutty.

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:10.367
What can I do for you fellows?

00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:13.461
Um, I was hoping to talk to you
about a friend of mine. Karim.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.963
Yeah. I remember seeing you
at the funeral.

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:17.132
Everything okay up here?

00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:18.544
Yeah. Uh...

00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:21.677
Gentlemen, meet Sergeant Keith Williams,
Staff Sergeant Eddie Dominguez.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.046
These fellows are friends of Karim's.
They want to talk.

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:25.534
Why don't y'all come back?
We'll have some coffee.

00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:26.969
Yeah. Decaf for me.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:28.143
What's that?

00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:30.227
I'd love a decaf.

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:31.791
We opened this facility two years ago,

00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:34.148
and we conduct therapy,
both physical and mental.

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:37.151
Not to mention, majority of our staff
that work here are retired vets.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.680
We help them feel more comfortable

00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.458
transitioning from service
to the workforce.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.531
<i>Last year, we started</i>

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:49.197
bringing back donated vehicles
damaged from overseas missions,

00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:50.910
and we refurbish them here,

00:36:51.084 --> 00:36:53.747
sell them, help make profits
for our rehab operations.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.940
It's crazy for us to go through
those three tours together

00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:57.108
and to just lose Karim like that.

00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:59.340
Yeah, it's tough. It's real tough.

00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:01.091
Hell, why didn't he just come to us?

00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:02.752
Maybe he was scared to.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.386
Scared? You ever been to war?

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:06.889
Front lines, Harlem, '80s.
That work for you?

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.458
What Dom's trying to say is

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:10.638
that the war really took its toll
on a lot of the men.

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:12.891
The drinking, drugs,

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.351
and, um, Karim was just...
He was the worst of all.

00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:16.606
He just couldn't cope.

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:19.189
And with the lack of funding
and the red tape

00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:21.194
the VA couldn't even begin
to start helping.

00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:24.232
That's why we started this place.
Brothers Watching Brothers.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:26.275
Built for soldiers by soldiers.

00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:28.115
See, now that's a better name.

00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:30.280
And, no surprise,
this place was Karim's idea.

00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:32.643
That's why it was so strange
when he started pulling away.

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:33.748
Pull out? What?

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.784
Away. He said "pulling away."

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:38.079
Yeah, ever since he found religion,

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.248
he basically stopped coming around.

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:41.711
Karim? Religious?

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:43.921
He was never that guy.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:46.883
Well, he started going to mosque uptown
after he met his girl, Anam.

00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:49.765
The Rashad Mosque?

00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:51.602
Yeah, I think that's right.

00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:54.016
Once they got together,
that's where he spent all his time.

00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:56.226
And that's probably
where he fell back into using.

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.586
Shit, man, you know what? I don't think
I wanna talk about this anymore.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.010
All right, hey, hey, hey. No, look.

00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:01.105
I'm sorry.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.199
- What exactly are y'all looking to find?
- Um...

00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:05.276
- We were just trying to get some...
- Closure.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.817
Just trying to get some closure here.
That's all.

00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:08.994
Yeah. Thanks, fellows.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.236
Yeah, of course.

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.870
- Appreciate you.
- Of course.

00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:18.585
Thanks for your help, guys.
I appreciate it.

00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:32.845
The hell is the matter with you?

00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:35.477
Something ain't right about that
Dominguez motherfucker

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:37.229
not making eye contact and shit.

00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:40.141
Maybe 'cause he's upset
he just lost his friend.

00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:44.687
I'm more concerned about that Anam girl
and the mosque.

00:38:44.864 --> 00:38:47.322
You know, the FBI monitors
that place for terrorist activity.

00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:48.969
So you think your boy
might've been a terrorist?

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.905
What? Of course not. No.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:54.072
Sounds like you saying
your friend was a terrorist.

00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:55.831
That's pretty fucked up, you ask me.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.457
Are you insane?

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:58.834
Karim was my best friend.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.439
I'm just saying that
there has to be a reason

00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:02.263
he didn't tell me
about that part of his life.

00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:04.585
Yeah, 'cause that motherfucker
was a fucking terrorist.

00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:05.759
Jesus.

00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:07.380
No. Allah.

00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:22.395
Oh, come on, man. White people
don't even listen to this shit.

00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:24.026
Come on.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.278
Mmm-hmm.

00:39:29.325 --> 00:39:32.409
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Now that's music.

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:37.115
<i>♪ If you think I got what you need ♪</i>

00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:39.033
<i>♪ Show you right ♪</i>

00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:40.294
Ooh-hoo!

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:42.537
I think you might've been conceived
to this song.

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.455
Thanks for that.

00:39:49.178 --> 00:39:51.921
Man, where are you going?
My place is in the opposite direction.

00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:54.260
I'm smarter than GPS, motherfucker.
I know that.

00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:55.925
We gotta make a pit stop.

00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.889
Oh, no! Please, no. I'm exhausted.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.178
Can you just take me home?

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:00.641
No can do.

00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:02.477
You coming with.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.906
No. No.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.100
I think I've seen enough of
Harlem's underbelly for today.

00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.831
I think I'm all good on this one.

00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:21.537
You wanna solve your case, right?

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.202
That's...

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:33.303
Hey, what does this place have to do
with solving the case?

00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:34.839
Just trust me, okay?

00:40:36.184 --> 00:40:37.345
Trust you?

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:42.479
You know, I really don't think
you understand what that word means.

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.644
Oh, man, it's turned up real.

00:41:34.283 --> 00:41:36.570
<i>You've got the best of my love</i>

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:37.744
Yeah, baby.

00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:41.371
You've got to be fucking kidding me!

00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.827
Trust you? Really?

00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:44.001
First drink's on me.

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:45.688
You said that we were coming here
for the case.

00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:48.455
We are. We're here to clear our heads,
blow off some steam.

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.167
That's the key to solving any case.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.458
No, I'm not about
to go clubbing with you.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:54.092
Why the fuck not?

00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:57.346
You're a 60-year-old man.
And it's a Tuesday.

00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:58.676
Rule number one,

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.890
any woman that dresses up to come out
on a Tuesday night is my kind of woman.

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.262
How you think I met your mama?

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.688
Okay, that's enough with the rules.

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.002
You know what? I'm out of here.

00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:10.814
Excuse me, gentlemen.
These are courtesy of those two ladies.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.192
Wow. Rule number two,

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.233
never turn down free drinks
from beautiful ladies.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.948
Hey, Shaft, looking good.

00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:22.579
Yeah, when you gonna let us give you
the two-for-one special?

00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.660
Who's your friend?

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.450
Oh. Ladies, this is my son.

00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:27.627
Junior.

00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.164
Oh, my God, you have a son?

00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:30.795
Look, I always get y'all mixed up...

00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:32.334
- Baby.
- And Sugar.

00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:33.628
- Sugar.
- Come here.

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.425
Oh. Okay. Come on now.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:37.336
Wait. Those can't be your real names.

00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:40.551
I bet there is nothing junior
about this Shaft.

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:43.183
Well, it's too bad you're not gonna
have a chance to find out

00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:45.059
'cause he was just about to leave.

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.229
What?

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.722
No, stay and have
a couple more drinks with us.

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:51.045
- Come on, please.
- You know you want to.

00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:52.355
Maybe one more drink.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.528
Okay!

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.816
Go! I said move.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.982
Get away! Thank you!

00:42:59.452 --> 00:43:01.739
Andre, we got a new friend!

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:03.825
Three of our favorites, Buttery Nipples.

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:05.392
Have you ever had a Buttery Nipple?

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.727
- Just put it in your mouth.
- Oh. Uh...

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:07.751
Cheers!

00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.418
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:12.691
- Okay, okay.
- In your mouth. In, in, in.

00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:14.251
- In.
- Yeah, and swallow.

00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.062
You've been out that boy life
20-some-odd years.

00:43:23.142 --> 00:43:24.822
Now, all of a sudden,
you wanna play daddy?

00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:26.434
That's fucked up. You know that?

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:27.604
"Play daddy"?

00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:29.208
Don't bullshit me, Shaft. You hear me?

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.584
You think you could tear up
half of Harlem,

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.190
chasing down Manny with your kid

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.726
and me not hear about it?

00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:36.131
Don't nothing happen in these streets
without me knowing.

00:43:36.155 --> 00:43:37.737
Yeah, and that's why I'm here.

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:42.033
Junior's got a lead I think is gonna
take me straight to Gordito.

00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:45.196
Now, that rat motherfucker's
about to stick his head up out his hole,

00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:47.285
and I'm gonna whack-a-mole
the shit out of him.

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.825
I need you to get some info
on this dude for me

00:43:50.002 --> 00:43:51.994
named Eddie Dominguez.

00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:53.171
Army vet.

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:54.879
Think he's involved with Gordito.

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:57.754
Works over at
Brothers Watching Brothers.

00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.404
That's a terrible motherfucking name.

00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:01.090
Yeah, they need to change that shit.

00:44:01.264 --> 00:44:02.264
I'll see what I can do.

00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:04.928
So, you're saying that,
with an associate's degree,

00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:08.185
I can then apply for night classes
and get my bachelor's?

00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:10.141
Absolutely. Yes.

00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:13.315
Oh. Dreaming and scheming is so sexy.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.692
Oh, girl! Let's dance!

00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:16.862
Oh, this is my song.

00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.104
Oh, God, y'all so strong.

00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:21.024
Of course, you know,
if Maya hear about this...

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.657
Maya don't know shit.

00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:24.138
And she ain't gonna know shit.
All right?

00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:25.120
Okay.

00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:26.121
Just...

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.331
Gordito's slimy ass has been
slipping through my fingers

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:31.249
since before this kid was born.

00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:33.581
This shit is personal.

00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:37.122
Now, if Junior is my ticket
to finally nailing his ass,

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.043
well, that's motherfucking
street poetic justice.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.427
You feel me?

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.759
Besides, I'm looking out for the boy!

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:46.924
I put him in the Baby-Sugar sandwich.

00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.412
What, you gonna be out here
with this shit on?

00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:50.302
Yeah. That's some good looking out
right there.

00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:51.515
What, you think you sexy?

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:52.896
Oh, shit!

00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:56.249
Bring me back a drink
or something, Shaft.

00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:57.984
Yeah, you might wanna hurry.

00:44:58.154 --> 00:44:59.674
- Get your hands off of me!
- Oh, shit!

00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:01.133
The fuck you doing over here with him?

00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:02.217
Who told you to come to this club?

00:45:02.241 --> 00:45:04.449
- What the fuck you got on?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.180
Hold up there, partner.
You don't want none of this.

00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:08.036
No, no, no, no, no. I got it. Trust me.

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:10.949
He's just upset
'cause he's wearing silk.

00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:12.991
Get your hands off me, motherfucker!

00:45:17.965 --> 00:45:19.752
I'll smack the shit out of you, man!

00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:22.654
What you gonna do, man?

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:23.839
Bob and weave, nigga.

00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:30.801
You motherfucking dancing?

00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.025
Shit!

00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:42.948
Oh!

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.030
Did you see that shit?

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:48.110
See? Like father, like son.

00:45:49.205 --> 00:45:50.696
Oh, shit!

00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:03.713
Come here!

00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:05.172
Oh, go to sleep, big fellow.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:08.723
One,

00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:10.010
two,

00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:11.184
three!

00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:13.895
He down!

00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:25.022
What the fuck was that?

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:26.199
It's capoeira.

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:27.325
What?

00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:30.076
It's, uh, Brazilian dance-fighting.

00:46:30.246 --> 00:46:32.829
Ma had me take lessons
when I was a kid, so...

00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.616
And, you know, when I get drunk,
it just comes out sometimes.

00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:38.126
I was this far from being proud of you.

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:39.912
What? I can teach you, man.

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:41.089
Come to the...

00:46:41.257 --> 00:46:42.257
All right.

00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:46.505
Sugar. Baby. Where were...

00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:49.255
Shit!

00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:51.723
Oh!

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.550
- That's nasty!
- What the fuck?

00:46:56.564 --> 00:46:58.180
Rule number three,

00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:01.608
never throw up on the hot girl
that's feeling you.

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.151
Whoo, what the fuck?

00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:10.318
I feel like I just stepped into
an apartment display

00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:11.651
in Pier 1 Imports or some shit.

00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:13.407
Oh, no, no.

00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:15.159
That a lemon tower?

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:17.953
You know what that says to me?

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.536
"I hate pussy."

00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:22.705
No, it makes a house a home.

00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:26.216
No, it makes a homo house.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.385
Hey.

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:30.595
Not cool.
You cannot use the H-word anymore.

00:47:30.765 --> 00:47:32.757
Oh, really? So what are you then?

00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.515
You a metrosexual?

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:38.224
Heteronormative? Cisgender? Fluid?

00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:39.763
Stop me when I tick your box.

00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:42.649
I don't feel good.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.060
Want ginger ale?

00:47:45.237 --> 00:47:46.728
I need some medicine.

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.647
It's on my desk.

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.031
All right.

00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:52.067
You gotta puke, puke in that.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.501
Sasha text.

00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:05.418
Ah. Late-night booty call.

00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:07.048
Maybe I underestimated you.

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:08.959
Nah, we're just friends.

00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:10.919
Survey says...

00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:12.429
I didn't.

00:48:12.598 --> 00:48:14.510
Oh, I fucked up.

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:16.299
I told her we were going to the mosque.

00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:18.844
Now she wants to come. No.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:22.230
It could be dangerous.
What if something goes down?

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.438
Lot of concern for somebody
whose ass you ain't tapping.

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:27.944
Look, me and Sasha,

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.276
there is no ass tapping.

00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:32.907
Ah. But you wanna be tapping
that ass though, don't you?

00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:33.952
Uh...

00:48:33.953 --> 00:48:35.410
- Right?
- Uh...

00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:42.377
Yeah.

00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:45.621
We all got that one special girl.

00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:49.382
Hey, could you grab me
a coconut water, please?

00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:51.088
Yeah, coconut water, coming up.

00:48:51.262 --> 00:48:53.219
I could use the electrolytes.

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:55.342
Oh-ho!

00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:56.724
You still got this?

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.240
Whoa.

00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.366
Yo!

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:15.450
Now, you know this is
a real Super Bowl ring, right?

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.155
Got this from LT.

00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:19.696
Did him a serious favor back in the day.

00:49:54.617 --> 00:49:55.858
Shit!

00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:06.125
Jesus! My head is killing me.

00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:08.628
Oh, don't be that
whiny hangover guy, son.

00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:09.830
Nobody likes that guy.

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:12.169
You know, just frown, grab your head,
and say,

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:16.337
"Damn, I kicked it too hard last night.
I am fucked up."

00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:18.346
That's the guy everybody wants
to hang with.

00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:20.007
Oh, shit. Sasha.

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.578
I thought you said she wasn't coming.

00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:22.809
She wasn't, but, you know,

00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:24.935
she's not exactly the type
to take no for an answer.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.064
Well, well, well. You must be Sasha.

00:50:28.234 --> 00:50:29.896
Yeah, literally just told him that.

00:50:30.236 --> 00:50:32.728
Uh, yeah, I am. And who are you?

00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:36.364
This is the private detective
that I've been working with.

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:38.867
He's also kind of my dad.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.447
Shaft.

00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:41.621
John Shaft.

00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:44.624
Wow.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.288
I'm sorry. I just...
I wouldn't know what you looked like

00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:49.919
because, you know, you haven't shown up
for the last 25 years.

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:51.089
Oh.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.251
Beautiful and fiery.

00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:53.960
What is he doing here, JJ?

00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:55.301
He's helping.

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.631
Really? I doubt it.

00:50:57.805 --> 00:50:58.805
Okay.

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:01.214
Now that we're all acquainted...

00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:02.661
I thought it was a good question.

00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:03.685
Yeah, sure.

00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:05.803
You okay?

00:51:06.188 --> 00:51:08.726
I'm just... I'm not feeling, um...

00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:10.692
Ah.

00:51:10.693 --> 00:51:13.436
Damn, I kicked it too hard last night.
I'm fucked up.

00:51:13.612 --> 00:51:15.882
He took me out last night.
We blew off some steam.

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.273
You should've seen
this motherfucker in the club.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.032
He was tearing it up!

00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:22.569
JJ turning up on a Tuesday, huh?

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:25.363
On a goddamn Tuesday.
Can you believe that?

00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:26.457
No.

00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:28.324
Boy's got more Shaft in him
than I thought.

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:30.564
Yeah, well, let's hope
that there's a prescription for that.

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:31.588
Shall we?

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:32.589
Yeah.

00:51:33.215 --> 00:51:35.694
Prescribe something
for them tight-ass jeans cutting off

00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:37.380
the blood to your brain.

00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:44.967
This is not feeling
like a terrorist training ground.

00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:46.144
I still don't know.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.812
Is that the girl from the funeral?

00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:51.598
- That has to be Anam.
- Yeah.

00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:55.403
May I help you?

00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:56.903
We'd like to talk to Anam.

00:51:57.406 --> 00:52:00.206
We didn't get a chance to meet,
but we're childhood friends with Karim,

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:02.196
and we'd really like
to ask you some questions.

00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:07.994
I met Karim not long
after he returned from the war.

00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:11.001
We didn't start dating
until early last year.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.627
That's when he got clean.

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.704
Everything was so perfect.

00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:16.623
Did Karim have any enemies?

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.200
Somebody who wanted to do him harm?

00:52:18.344 --> 00:52:19.344
No.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.836
He had so much to live for.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.410
He was building our new youth center.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:25.808
Oh.

00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.135
Yeah, that's nice.

00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:29.678
Any way we can look inside it?

00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:31.972
No, you may not.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.210
This is highly inappropriate.
You cannot speak to my daughter.

00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:35.315
Please excuse my father.

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.943
Your father's imam?

00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:38.193
Yes.

00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:40.856
Sir, please excuse us.

00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:42.033
No. You must leave now.

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:46.870
So are you a Muslim
from a Muslim country,

00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:51.826
or did you find Allah
in some cell block?

00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:53.869
What did you say to me?

00:52:54.046 --> 00:52:56.208
Can we just calm down
for one second, please?

00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:58.874
Zakat? Zakat?

00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:01.213
Yes, yes! Zakat.

00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:03.504
How about a donation
as a sign of good faith?

00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:05.138
You got change for a ten?

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:06.889
What is that? FBI?

00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:08.425
You are FBI?

00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:10.594
What? Where'd you get
that crazy idea from?

00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:12.888
Do I look like I'm in the FBI?

00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:15.727
Out! Out at once!

00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.148
Jeez.

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:27.236
You know, I'm trying to give homeboy
the benefit of the doubt,

00:53:27.413 --> 00:53:29.120
but that motherfucker is annoying.

00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:30.308
You know, I need to find out

00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:32.412
how much zakat
it's gonna take to build one of those.

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:36.536
Oh. I'm thinking a shitload for sure.

00:53:36.714 --> 00:53:39.297
Only problem is
my laptop's registered to the Bureau.

00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:41.226
I need to get to a computer
they can't trace.

00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:43.502
I got a computer you can use
in my office.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.796
Whoa.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.050
Where'd you get a computer?

00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:48.424
I won it in a game show called

00:53:48.517 --> 00:53:50.634
<i>Beat the Shit Out
of a Piece-of-Shit Drug Dealer</i>

00:53:50.728 --> 00:53:51.871
<i>and You Get to Keep His Shit.</i>

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:52.895
Cute.

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.104
So I have a shift to catch
at the hospital.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.190
I'm gonna talk to you later, okay?

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.557
Okay. I'll call you.

00:53:57.735 --> 00:54:00.443
- Okay.
- Or you know what? I can text you

00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:03.275
because we've got text history for days,
so I can...

00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:05.862
I'll, yeah, get the thumbs
working on that.

00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:08.394
Why the hell can't you young people
just talk to each other?

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.487
Fuck a text. It's a phone. Call her.

00:54:10.664 --> 00:54:12.704
Or better yet,
why don't you just take her to dinner

00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:14.498
and debrief her over the meal?

00:54:15.002 --> 00:54:17.460
Dinner?
That actually sounds really nice.

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:21.089
It does. Yeah, yeah!

00:54:21.842 --> 00:54:23.202
I'll call you about, about dinner.

00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:24.571
Awesome. I'll talk to you later.

00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:25.595
Okay.

00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:26.596
Bye.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.426
All right, thanks.

00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.189
You got to stop being
so afraid of women, son.

00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:42.443
You know, women... want a man
to be a man.

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.275
They don't want some pussy.

00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:46.360
Well, some women want some pussy.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.862
Some women want both.

00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:50.447
That's my preference.

00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:55.457
But, in general,
women want a man to be manly.

00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:02.790
I'm pretty sure women don't like
being told what it is that they like.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.548
See, that's the shit I'm talking about.

00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:06.129
Men used to be men.

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:09.011
Now, you millennial motherfuckers
are running around worrying about

00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:13.300
what women think and how they feel
and apologizing and shit.

00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:14.477
It's embarrassing.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.307
Apologizing is embarrassing?

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:21.065
Yes, men don't apologize.
That's a trap they set for us.

00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:23.227
Real men just own their shit.

00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:26.737
No, real men take responsibility
for what they do.

00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:29.115
Real men are strong enough
to admit when they're wrong.

00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:31.429
Real men are strong enough to put
their foot in a motherfucker's ass

00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:32.694
when they get pissed off.

00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:34.533
What is that, the Shaft family motto?

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:36.698
It's an unwritten rule, Stephen A.

00:55:37.084 --> 00:55:38.324
Shit.

00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:40.628
Who that?

00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:42.296
It's Ma.

00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:45.248
Do not tell her you're with me.

00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:47.967
Oh, ho-ho!

00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:50.379
Look who's being a little bitch now.

00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:52.596
You're about to be
the victim of the unwritten rule.

00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:54.010
Don't fuck around.

00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:55.101
Uh-huh.

00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.269
Hey, Ma.

00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:58.557
Hey, baby. I'm just checking in.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:02.849
Oh, you know what?
I'm so, so happy that you called.

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:06.440
Ma, you will not believe
who I've been hanging out with.

00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:07.899
<i>Who?</i>

00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:10.283
Sasha.

00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:13.075
<i>Aw, Sasha. I love her.</i>

00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:15.532
I'm so glad you two have each other
to get through this.

00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:17.413
<i>- Will you tell her I say hi?</i>
- I will.

00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:18.768
Listen, I'd love to see you
this weekend.

00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:20.395
I'm coming into the city tonight
for a date.

00:56:20.419 --> 00:56:21.419
With who?

00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:23.749
Since when do you care about me dating?

00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:25.914
No, you're right. Sorry, Ma.

00:56:26.091 --> 00:56:27.798
Forget I even said anything.

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:29.425
He's picking me up from the hotel

00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:31.753
and taking me
to this place called, uh, Trista's.

00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:32.805
Oh.

00:56:32.806 --> 00:56:33.967
Well, that's good.

00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:36.383
Well, um, just call me
when you get in town, all right?

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.704
I love you. Talk to you later.

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:38.768
<i>I love you too, baby. Bye.</i>

00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:39.854
All right, bye.

00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:42.142
How many motherfuckers
your mom been with since me?

00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:45.687
Nine or ten, maybe.

00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.194
Oh.

00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:48.195
Well, nothing serious.

00:56:48.363 --> 00:56:49.483
Cool.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.356
Ooh-wee!

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.244
Wait a minute.
If you don't use a computer,

00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:02.979
how do you keep track
of all of your case files?

00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.289
I got a system.

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:10.709
Unbelievable.

00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:13.845
You have unlimited information
available to you in seconds,

00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:17.132
the tools to store and to organize
all your files,

00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:20.177
graphics, music, HD porn,

00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:22.095
- and that's your system?
- HD porn?

00:57:22.898 --> 00:57:24.230
Can you hook that up to the TV?

00:57:25.317 --> 00:57:26.317
Music, too.

00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:31.739
Whoa.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.697
All the mosque files are encrypted.

00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:35.904
Like, crazy encrypted.

00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:37.078
Shouldn't they be?

00:57:37.245 --> 00:57:38.965
Yeah, if they're up
to some real shady shit.

00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:40.600
All right,
I'm gonna have to work some magic

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:42.936
if I'm gonna have any chance
of phishing the quantum network

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.328
and converging the endpoint protection
platforms to unlock this data.

00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:47.838
Yeah, okay.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.297
You do what you do.

00:57:57.099 --> 00:57:58.099
I'm in.

00:57:59.017 --> 00:58:00.303
Oh, hey, come look at this.

00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:03.220
$500,000 directly deposited

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:07.057
to the cleric's personal account
from El Supermercado Fantastico.

00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:10.147
I've been in this neighborhood forever.
I ain't never heard of that one.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.403
Well, apparently,
this one just opened up.

00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:18.113
A grocery store gave a half million
dollars to the cleric directly?

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:21.831
Who that?

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:22.832
It's my boss.

00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.043
Agent Vietti.

00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:27.664
Why am I looking at an empty desk?

00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:29.204
<i>I'm sorry. You know that mosque?</i>

00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:30.775
I think I actually found
some information.

00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:32.759
The one I specifically told you
to stay away from?

00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:34.254
Well, yeah, I know, but...

00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:35.964
<i>You disobeyed a direct order.</i>

00:58:36.138 --> 00:58:38.471
You placed a highly classified operation
in jeopardy.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.760
Effective immediately,
you're on administrative leave.

00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:42.050
What?

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:43.519
For how long?

00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:45.206
Till I think you know your fucking role!

00:58:47.566 --> 00:58:50.559
"Administrative leave"?
"Know my fucking role"?

00:58:50.736 --> 00:58:52.227
I'm the best analyst they've got!

00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:54.983
That's what you get
for working for the Man.

00:58:56.074 --> 00:59:00.569
So, you gonna stay on the porch,
or you gonna come run with the big dogs?

00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:03.704
We're going grocery shopping.

00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.555
Uh-oh. My bad.

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:22.761
Who the fuck are you?

00:59:22.934 --> 00:59:23.934
Who the fuck am I?

00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:26.060
Uh, uh... Oh.

00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:29.230
I'm sorry. He doesn't know
how to properly speak to women.

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:33.268
We're just here looking for the owner.
Bennie.

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:34.820
I'm Bennie.

00:59:36.073 --> 00:59:37.689
And, again,

00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:39.323
who the fuck are you?

00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:41.404
Could you give us one moment, please?

00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:46.330
Yo, what is wrong with you?

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.832
She picked up a bat.

00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:50.321
Oh. So what you gonna do?
You gonna break her fingers, too?

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.127
- You can't beat up a woman.
- Why not?

00:59:52.297 --> 00:59:55.040
Because she's a woman.
That's, like, misogynistic.

00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:57.880
You the one being misogynistic.
I ain't mention her gender.

00:59:58.053 --> 00:59:59.906
You the one bringing up her
being a woman and shit.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.616
- I don't give a fuck about her gender.
- Okay.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.222
I'm an equal opportunity ass-whooper.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.553
All right. Just... Can I handle this?

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.560
Thank you.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.682
Hi, Bennie. We don't want any trouble.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.139
You know, we just came to ask you
just a couple questions.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.529
Damn!

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.483
I was just trying to talk!

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.529
Now, my son says I can't put hands
on you 'cause you a woman.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.698
Now, since I can't whoop your ass,

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.790
I'm gonna have to beat
the shit out of your shit.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.914
What the fuck?

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:38.708
There's no nonviolent people in Harlem?

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:39.885
Junior.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:41.753
Damn, she's strong!

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.296
I think she's ready to talk.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.222
Oh, it's bleeding!

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:47.768
You know this guy?

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:51.772
English, please.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.315
The boy speaks Mexican,
not Puerto Rican.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.068
No.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.602
What about a guy named Farik?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:00:59.905
Oh.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.613
So you do know Farik.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.947
Well, let's talk about that 500K
you sent Farik

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:06.347
and his friends up at the mosque.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.613
Hey, you better find a whole new answer
or something

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.470
'cause he's running out
of things to shoot.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.040
The mosque is a staple of the community.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:18.251
Supermercado is proud
to support all groups.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.425
Really?

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.426
Really.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.086
You remind me...

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.008
Bennie,

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.221
have you and me

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.727
ever done the horizontal boogie?

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:34.815
No, <i>papi.</i>

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.400
I'd remember fucking a black guy
dressed like Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:43.443
That shit was ostrich!

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:44.698
I don't give a fuck.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:45.868
What was that for?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.956
I'm sick of these
Laurence Fishburne comparisons.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.328
It's just getting old.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.581
Oh.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.541
You know what?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.451
We gonna leave you alone.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.119
Yippee.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:59.380
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> Bennie.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.298
I meant to say that shit
like Schwarzenegger.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.872
Oh, yeah, you gotta be deeper.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:08.676
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:13.352
I know I've seen Bennie
somewhere before.

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:16.059
I ain't sure she wasn't lying
about me tapping that ass.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.440
You gotta be kidding me, man.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:20.067
You're never gonna find
anything on her in this mess.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.644
Ta-da!

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.147
No way.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:26.659
How'd you just do that?

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.450
I told you I got a system.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.363
This is my
"Puerto Ricans I don't trust" file.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:34.783
You literally have a racist-based
catalog system?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.292
Ain't that how the FBI does it?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.461
Yeah, pretty much.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.667
God-motherfucking-damn!

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
Got her!

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.041
Oh, shit! That's Bennie.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:45.552
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.114
Who is this dude that she's with?

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:50.597
That is Pierro "Gordito" Carrera.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.724
<i>He's been the head
of the</i> Las Caras <i>boys,</i>

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.853
<i>you know, the baddest gang up in Harlem,
since, like, forever.</i>

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.139
Those motherfuckers
were the ones responsible

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.099
for bringing crack
into the hood in the '80s.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:04.738
Now, they're the reason 45's
talking about "an opioid epidemic."

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.691
What I can't figure out is

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:11.201
<i>what business a motherfucker like this
has got with a mosque.</i>

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:16.537
Maybe Supermercado Fantastico's just
a front for the <i>Las Caras'</i> drug money.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.128
You know, they could be using
the cleric's mission trips

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:23.415
over to Afghanistan to bring in heroin.

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.711
Karim probably found out about it,
and they killed him

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.947
because he was gonna
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.337
That's very, very possible.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:33.007
Damn, I can't wait to push this
in Vietti's stupid face.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.972
No, no, no, no, no.
We gonna solve this shit ourselves.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.183
Then I'll tell you the Shaft way

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.643
to tell that dickhead boss of yours
to kiss your ass.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.479
No, that's what I meant.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.985
But first, we gotta put eyes on Bennie,

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.771
so we can get some proof.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.736
So I'mma go out, get some coffee,
a bunch of Papaya dogs,

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.026
and we gonna do
an old-fashioned stakeout.

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:55.492
Uh, how about we don't do anything
that starts with "old-fashioned."

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.785
I planted a micro-cam on Bennie's desk.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:08.005
So, you know, we can
watch the footage back tomorrow morning.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.340
Take the night off, big dog.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.074
I'mma go get dressed
for dinner with Sasha.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.589
Hanging out with Mom after.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.009
Why the fuck would you be hanging out
with your mom after

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.519
when you should be knee-deep in pussy?

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.974
Knee-deep?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.140
Like, I don't even know
what direction the...

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:24.559
You know what? Never mind. You're right.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.576
I don't know where in the world
I would be without your fatherly wisdom.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.692
Better late than never.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.359
Go tear that ass up, son.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.694
Oh. You want to use my car?

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.408
No, I don't have no driver's license.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:38.948
Me neither.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.792
And, son, remember,

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:46.335
it's your duty to please that booty.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:52.170
Give her the Shaft, big boy.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.217
This is crazy.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:57.850
You're telling me that the cleric
and this gang are working together?

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.705
Yeah, it was hard for me
to believe at first, too.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.893
Even if any of this is true, why would
Karim have anything to do with it?

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.978
I don't know, but I'mma find out.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.484
And when I do,
whoever killed him is gonna be sorry.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.021
Starting to sound a lot like your dad.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.319
What? Are you serious?

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.451
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:18.196
You motherfucking think I sound like
that goddamn motherfucker?

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.372
He's actually really funny though.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.786
You should see the way
the people in Harlem react to him.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.423
He's, like, a legend.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.925
Well, I mean,
I'm happy your dad's funny,

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.055
but doesn't make up for the fact that
he abandoned you when you were a baby

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.881
and wanted nothing to do with you.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.345
All right, look.

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.601
He's obviously screwed up,

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.515
borderline insane,

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.060
but, deep down,
I feel like he's actually an okay dude.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.111
Don't get me wrong.

01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:55.984
There's no way that I'm just gonna
forget that he abandoned me as a kid.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.615
Okay.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.075
Hi.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.064
Would you like me to take your coat?

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.795
Oh, sure. Thank you.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.503
Ooh, lookie here.
Will someone call Ripley's?

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:15.044
'Cause this woman is too beautiful
to be believed.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.712
Thank you so much.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.451
Well, you know,
you don't look so bad yourself.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.216
Well, you know, I do what I do.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.885
"...put some goddamn pants on.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:25.019
You LT. You're a Super Bowl hero.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.227
Not LD, porno star."

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.420
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:30.480
You know him?

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.237
Unfortunately.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.691
Who is he, exactly?

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.745
Just somebody who destroys
everything he touches

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:37.358
and never seems to go away.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.409
Oh. He's a contractor.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.822
I'm sorry. I just...

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:46.270
I just need to go to the bathroom.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.375
Okey-dokey.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.171
Uh...

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.672
I'm sorry?

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.382
Okey-dokey.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.960
"Okey-dokey."

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.799
That is what you said.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:06:58.972
I'll be waiting.

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.183
Oh, lookie here!

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.598
Maya, Maya!

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:09.231
Ghetto rose gracing Harlem
with your presence.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.312
Damn, girl. You're looking good.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:12.486
How long has it been?

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.106
Hmm. Never long enough.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.027
I can see you're enjoying yourself
as usual.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.951
Lady Syphilis, Madam Chlamydia,

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.452
it's lovely to meet you both.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.286
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am actually on a date.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.978
That's where the guy
pays for your dinner

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.163
before you have sex with him,

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:31.954
and not all three.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:33.417
Try it.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.778
- Good seeing you.
- Bad seeing you.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:37.543
That's Junior's mama.
She's a little bitter.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.461
Don't worry about her though.
Come on, now.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:43.132
How did this motherfucker know
where I was?

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.184
Is this motherfucker following me?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.188
He's trying...
He's trying to get me back.

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:50.626
Motherfucker, I don't want you back.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.812
And I'm happy. I'm so happy.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.773
I'm gonna be the happiest bitch.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.903
The girls weren't even cute.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.134
They looked sad. Did they look sad
to you? Looked sad to me.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:01.275
I like a nigga with no swag.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.409
I'm about the swagless motherfucker
with a check.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.891
You think just 'cause you walk
around here smelling good...

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.623
I'm not even mad.
And 'cause you got a big fucking...

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:09.954
I mean, honestly.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.790
Fucking niggas.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.008
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.263
What the fuck?

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:25.720
My man. VSOP times three.

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:27.600
Make that one chardonnay.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.188
Chardonnay.

01:08:30.315 --> 01:08:31.476
What are you doing?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.106
I'm vetting homie here.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.196
I heard you kicked
ten motherfuckers to the curb,

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.360
so this must be number 11.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.779
No, no, that is not true.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.405
It's five at most.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.942
Still no luck replacing
that magic stick, huh?

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:44.930
Motherfucking magic stick.
You think I'm talking about...

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:45.954
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.330
No offense, but this is a table for two.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:49.539
- Yes, it is.
- Two people.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.626
One, two.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:52.243
It is, isn't it?

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:54.921
Yes, it is.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.172
Ron, let's go.
I told you he was an asshole.

01:08:57.342 --> 01:08:59.959
Come on, Maya.
You know that's not true.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.425
I don't cause problems.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.102
I solve them.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.761
Well, solve this.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:12.597
- Maya.
- What?

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.226
Duck.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:24.403
What the fuck?

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:25.943
Feel like old times, don't it?

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:33.377
John!

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.380
Roll, baby, roll. Don't stop.

01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:41.802
Hold still.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.221
Get them, Shaft!

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.395
Whoop his ass!

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.393
Ron, calm the fuck down!

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:58.066
Stop screaming like a bitch, Ron!

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:39.501
Why is it that every time I'm around you
it's a fucking gunfight?

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.092
Oh, so now you're trying to act like

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.754
a little gunfire
don't still turn you on?

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.612
Why do you think that
that shit turns me on?

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.282
Them hard-ass nipples.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.493
This is not a joke, John!

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.392
This is why JJ and I had to leave
your ass in the first place, remember?

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.623
Oh, shit! Junior.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:57.535
"Junior"? What do you mean, "Junior"?

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.750
Please tell me that you did not
get him involved in your bullshit.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.209
- You drive?
- No.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.300
Uh, excuse me, Maya.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:05.320
- I don't think this is gonna work...
- Did you drive?

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:06.585
Awesome. Come on.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.887
Excuse me, but it's my car.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.536
The date ain't over. Come on.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.935
It is a lease.
Could you be a little more careful?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.540
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:19.209
but if you don't get our son out of
this shit that you've gotten him into...

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.833
- Maya, I didn't get him in...
- You're his father! He's your son!

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:24.361
Not that I expect you to understand
what that means,

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.341
but there is one fucking rule.
You keep him safe!

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.365
I'm trying.

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.991
No, John Shaft, you're failing!

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.161
Again!

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.455
I still can't believe
that you're in the FBI.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:43.632
What?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.258
You used to get your ass kicked
when we were kids.

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.089
What was that guy's name?

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.622
Mike Mitchell.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.343
Yes! He would steal your pudding cup
at lunch every day.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:55.976
Until Karim dropped his ass
in front of the whole school.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.145
You remember that?

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.101
He had to give me a pudding cup
every day after that.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:01.390
Surprise!

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.479
That sounds like him.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.610
Happy birthday!

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.323
Move, move!

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.159
Take cover!

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.143
I thought you were joking
when you said you had a gun.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.167
It's my First Amendment.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.250
No, that's freedom of speech.
Let me see this thing.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:35.472
Get over here!

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:37.801
Somebody help!

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:44.461
Ugh.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:45.786
I hate guns.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:47.875
Sash, you okay?

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:50.002
Yeah.

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:04.934
What the fuck?

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.376
Where did you learn how to do that?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.629
I said I wasn't a gun guy.
I didn't say I couldn't shoot.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.653
Oh.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.123
Yeah.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.377
Got your ass.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:28.880
Oh.

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:29.881
This can't be good.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:30.882
Oh, my God!

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.340
Let's go. Let's go.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.340
- Ma?
- JJ!

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.218
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay!

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:40.767
So y'all all right?

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:45.395
Good job, son.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.529
Yeah, regular chip
off the same fucked-up block.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.441
- Don't you do that anymore.
- Ow.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.144
You're worse than the shooters.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.437
Dad, check this out.

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.634
I got this off of one of the shooters,

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:56.802
and I traced the hit
straight back to Bennie.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:57.826
Boom!

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.661
That's not all. Look, this thing is
full of messages about a huge drop,

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.265
and you can get all this stuff
from the carrier.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:03.433
Like, nothing's ever really erased.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:04.457
Until you delete it.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.994
No. No, that's what I'm saying.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.160
Like, you can't truly delete
anything, ever.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.537
Even, like, pictures you text?

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:10.732
Yeah, they're still on the server.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:11.756
- For real?
- Yeah.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:12.757
Oh, shit.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.424
No, no, no, no, no!

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:15.925
No, it's okay. This is mine.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.095
JJ used it.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.741
- Oh, it's pretty. I like the purple.
- And he's gonna buy me bullets.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.097
Wait a minute. Look at this.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.304
"Another shipment from Afghanistan."

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.053
Say anything about Gordito being there?

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.888
Um... No.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.418
But between this
and the bank statements,

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.442
that's more than enough evidence

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:33.811
to tie the <i>Las Caras</i> gang
to the cleric, right?

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:34.988
So what's next?

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.398
We go back up
to the Supermercado Fantastico

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:38.607
and bust some heads open?

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.989
Motherfucker, no.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:47.203
You know, now just might be
the right time

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:48.909
to turn the case over to the FBI.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:50.668
What?

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:53.000
Wait. What happened to
solving this shit ourselves?

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.290
You did!

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.460
Now, you get to rub your
dickhead boss's face in it, you dig?

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.465
Yep.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:02.805
I dig, I guess.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.716
Are you sure about that?

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:06.851
Yeah.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.936
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.601
- JJ.
- Yeah?

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.019
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:19.948
So Maya and John Shaft
have a baby together.

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:22.909
You know, they say that cat Shaft
is a bad mother...

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.615
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.759
<i>Disturbing and frightening footage
coming out of Harlem</i>

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:43.798
<i>where a team of FBI agents raided
the Rashad Azzam Mosque this afternoon.</i>

01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:46.967
<i>No word on what, exactly,
they were looking for,</i>

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:48.555
<i>but the Bureau has acknowledged</i>

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:52.439
<i>that no evidence of foul play
or terrorist ties were discovered,</i>

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.349
<i>leaving many left to wonder,</i>

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:58.146
<i>does the FBI have a racist,
Islamophobic bias?</i>

01:16:58.823 --> 01:16:59.984
Fuck me.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:03.400
You know, for him to just automatically
assume we're Islamophobic

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:04.909
is actually racist for him.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.079
Shut up.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.440
I can't believe I listened to you.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.702
What? What about all the evidence?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.186
You think you can fuck up this badly

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.202
and not leave here
with all your shit in a box?

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.940
And we haven't even gotten
to your little firefight

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.876
and the illegal search
of the bank records.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.210
We're done here.

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:21.548
Leave your badge and your ID.
Clear out your shit.

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:34.899
Yo, who this?

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.828
<i>Yeah, I got that information
you wanted on the Dominguez kid.</i>

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:38.987
Talk to me.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.945
Clean, far as I can tell.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:42.115
Decorated soldier,

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.449
<i>nothing but love from everybody
in the neighborhood.</i>

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.951
Only thing is his family.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.783
- What about them?
<i>- A cousin.</i>

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:50.788
Runs with <i>Las Caras</i> boys.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.540
She washes the money, from what I hear.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:53.791
<i>This cousin got a name?</i>

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.122
Sure do.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:56.707
Bennie Rodriguez.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.333
All right, my man.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.751
You always come through for me.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:03.928
<i>Goddamn right.</i>

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.213
<i>So I guess, now that you got this lead
on Gordito's ass,</i>

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.388
<i>you can finally stop fucking around
with Maya's kid?</i>

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.642
- Yeah, something like that.
<i>- I'll holla.</i>

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:11.811
Wow.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.688
And to think this whole time I actually
thought that you wanted to help me.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.602
It's not like what you...

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.362
You've been using me
to solve your own case.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.650
When I first came to you about Karim,
the first thing that crossed your mind

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:28.363
wasn't that it could lead to Gordito?

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.580
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.290
And now you got what you needed,

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:37.077
you can abandon me again
and go ahead and follow him now, right?

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:38.454
What am I supposed to do? Hmm?

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:42.632
Dominguez is a trained soldier
who's apparently not afraid to kill,

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:45.669
and Gordito is the most
dangerous motherfucker in the city.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.342
I put you through enough, son.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:51.203
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:55.267
So, now, for the first time in my life,
you wanna pretend to be my father?

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:57.101
I am your father.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:01.109
No, you had a choice
between being my father and being Shaft.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.562
And you chose.

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:57.623
<i>Nigga, I'm not gonna
keep dealing with this shit.</i>

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.125
<i>Now, I done told you,</i>

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:02.333
<i>I don't know who the fuck
or what the fuck you think this is.</i>

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.191
Oh, God, please.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:25.928
<i>I gotta get him away from all this.</i>

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.071
<i>No. Maya, Maya...</i>

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:28.688
<i>I have to get him away from you!</i>

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.282
Who is it?

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.385
Maya, it's me. John.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:50.553
John?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.679
But how did you...

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.264
Never mind. What do you want?

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:55.452
You ain't gonna let me in?

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:56.476
I can hear you.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.455
Come on, girl. Open the door.
Let me see your face.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.437
Nigga, no,
I ain't opening the door,

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:00.438
and you don't need to see my face.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:01.439
What do you want?

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.681
Come on, give me a...

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:09.947
Look.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:12.820
I came by because...

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.111
I wanted to tell you that...

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.542
I'm sorry.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:25.919
Is this nigga high?

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.834
I never heard you say that before.

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:33.879
Yeah, I never said it before,

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.390
but I mean it.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.180
Sorry for putting you
in harm's way last night,

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.395
and I'm sorry
for putting our son in danger.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.274
John, you promised me a long time ago,

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.480
you said,
as long as you were living this life,

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.236
that you would stay away from JJ.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:51.942
We agreed.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.571
Yeah, I know. But he's my son, so...

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:07.836
He's my son, too, Maya.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.132
He came to me. He asked me for help.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:13.008
Now that I've gotten to know him,

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:16.012
things just can't go back
to being the way they were.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:20.054
Wait. He came to you?

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.227
Yeah.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:24.683
Wow. I...

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:29.643
I spent all these years
trying to keep him away from this mess,

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.983
but, at the end of the day,
I guess he's still a Shaft.

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:34.907
Yeah.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:39.994
Well,

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.913
if JJ's gonna put himself in danger,

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.949
at least I know
you'll be there to protect him.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:47.164
Yeah. I will.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:50.463
Yeah, I know.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.248
So...

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.626
So...

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.259
You're gonna break a brother off?

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:03.848
You had to fuck it up, didn't you?

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.517
Yeah, she thinking about it.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:16.606
We were wrong.

01:23:16.783 --> 01:23:19.571
The cleric wasn't the supplier
for <i>Las Caras</i>. Dominguez was.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:21.907
Bennie is Dominguez's cousin.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.309
So Bennie's the one who put out the hit
on us at the restaurant.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.333
Right.

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.341
I mean, think about it.
It makes perfect sense.

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.915
Dominguez goes overseas
with the other brothers to visit troops.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:33.377
They bring the damaged vehicles
back to the States filled with drugs.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.587
All right, I need to get closer.
Just wait here.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.627
- What the hell? No.
- No, trust me.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:40.164
It's not that I don't think
that you can do it. It's just...

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:41.933
I need you.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.216
Watch my back.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.144
Please?

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:47.770
Just text me if, uh, Dominguez moves.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.022
Okay.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.478
- Go. Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, yeah.

01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:21.407
This is all going to hell.
I told you not to kill Karim.

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:22.431
Relax.

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:23.826
What's your big plan now?
'Cause you always got one.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.850
- Enough.
- What is it?

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:25.851
Seriously.

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:27.163
'Cause now they're getting close,

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:29.040
and, now, Bennie got popped,
and now they know it wasn't the cleric.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.458
It's only a matter of time
before they end up here.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:31.598
You're being paranoid.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:32.775
Oh, now it's me?

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:34.087
We just need to continue as planned.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.319
We'll get the stuff to Gordito...

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:37.590
Gordito?
No, no, no. Fuck that, man.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.981
Smuggling drugs was supposed
to be temporary, okay?

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.649
This is all your fault.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.114
You got us into it. Now get us out.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.990
No, no. That's some simple bitch shit.

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:49.953
Okay, we ain't gonna be her.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:55.205
It's funny because you never seemed
to mind after I cut you in.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:58.361
Yo, Keith, this is getting out of hand.
We need to turn ourselves in right now.

01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:01.719
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like Karim,

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:04.843
and look where that got him.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:07.954
It is gonna break Bennie's heart when
I tell her that her cousin was a snitch.

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:10.345
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Cutty?

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:15.232
It means I'm not gonna let loose ends
mess this up.

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:16.938
That's what it means.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.650
I mean, did you think
that we should turn ourselves in?

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:20.859
Huh? Did you?

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:22.325
Fuck!

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:24.905
Fuck! My phone!

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.078
Shit!

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.621
It's that Shaft kid! He saw everything!

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:32.750
Get him!

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.472
Come on!

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.157
JJ!

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.088
The phone!

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:20.498
Now!

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.837
I'm not gonna ask again!

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:24.665
Don't give it to him, JJ!

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:26.472
Hey. Stop.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Come on.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:28.969
Put it on the ground.

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:30.726
Now!

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.158
Junior, get in the car!

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.331
Oh, shit!

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.208
Oh!

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:56.493
Down!

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:00.589
JJ!

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:02.673
Sasha!

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:05.970
Let's go!

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.212
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:08.596
I'm in! Go, go!

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:13.434
JJ!

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:21.396
Oh... Ah.

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:31.945
That motherfucker's got to die.

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.284
We need to go find Sasha.

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:39.953
Can't the FBI handle that?

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.963
You just don't think that I can do this.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:46.126
Look, I know the only person
that you give a fuck about is Gordito,

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:47.303
but I can't lose her.

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:49.053
And I can't lose you.

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.840
You wanna know
why I want Gordito so badly?

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.717
That motherfucker is the reason

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:57.053
our family got torn apart
in the first place.

01:27:57.647 --> 01:28:00.390
Now, he came for me.
Your mom was in the car. So were you.

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:01.808
You were just a baby.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:04.272
I can't let that shit go.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:06.108
But you know what?

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:10.484
Fuck Gordito
if it means I lose my son again.

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.681
I didn't come here
looking for that motherfucker.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.492
I came here looking for you.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.367
Thanks.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.088
I'm glad you came.

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:26.590
I'm actually a little impressed
that you found me.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.003
I keep telling you I know way more
about this city than that GPS shit.

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.090
You know what?
I think I can track Sasha's phone.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:36.329
I just gotta get to a computer.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:37.389
I got you.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:39.394
Officer Thomas, let me holla at you.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:43.022
What is it, Shaft?

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.295
You got something you wanna tell me

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.359
about this little shit storm
that blew through here?

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.155
No,

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.398
but my son needs to book a flight.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.316
You mind if he uses your computer?

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:54.578
Book a flight?

01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:56.205
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:02.831
So Cutty was running the drugs.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.997
Gordito was selling them.
And Bennie was laundering the money.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.211
Excuse me. Um, I'm sorry.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:11.253
Do y'all want some mints?
Charge your cell phone?

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.657
Y'all need some music or something?

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:13.825
No. No, thank you. We're good.

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.243
All right. Well, you need something,
you just let me know.

01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:17.147
- Thanks.
- Got it all right here for you, okay?

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.227
Okay.

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:19.395
So I figure

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:21.896
Dominguez was using Cutty as a pawn

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.023
to get in the game
with Bennie and Gordito.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.152
Did you say "Gordito"? Ain't that like
a big burrito or something?

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.321
Say what?

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:30.528
Shit is good.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:33.692
When the other brothers found out,
then Cutty tried to just cut them in,

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:35.280
but Karim wasn't going for that.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:36.472
Speaking of the Kareems,

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.296
why come y'all think it is that
Jabbar don't get the credit he deserve?

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.990
He scored more points than Jordan,

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:42.283
- LeBron...
- Babycakes.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.021
- Mmm.
- In case you ain't noticed,

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.125
we trying to work some shit out
back here, all right?

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.252
Oh. You just having a conversation
out loud, so I thought I could be in it.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:50.426
My bad.

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:52.419
Now that still don't explain the mosque.

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:54.073
Well, maybe when Karim
didn't take the money,

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:55.408
they tried to just make him happy

01:29:55.432 --> 01:29:58.015
by having Bennie forward his amount
to the cleric.

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.184
Right.

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:01.080
That way the cleric wouldn't know
the money was dirty.

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:03.824
Yeah, but I don't think that Karim
could live with knowing the truth,

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.770
and Cutty couldn't have any loose ends,
so their only option...

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:08.319
Kill Karim.

01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:11.524
Y'all gonna kill Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:14.051
No! But I'm about to kill you
if you don't mind your damn business

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.566
and drive this fucking car.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:21.030
If we're gonna take on <i>Las Caras,</i>
we're gonna need a lot more firepower.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:22.887
I know just the motherfucker
to hook us up.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.450
Look here, sweetheart.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:26.711
I need to change the address
we're going to.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.416
Oh, you talking to me now?

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.985
I don't actually need to know.
You just need to put it into the app.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.090
Put it in the... What?

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.501
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.718
How come I couldn't just
tell her where we're going?

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.033
No doorbell?

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:58.822
He don't believe in those.
Just bang on the door on your left.

01:30:58.995 --> 01:30:59.995
Okay.

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.737
You know, on second thought, fuck it.

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:06.121
This motherfucker never locks his door.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.287
Yo! Where you at?

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:11.626
<i>But I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a drunk.</i>

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.550
<i>Alcoholics gotta go
to them goddamn meetings.</i>

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:18.971
That's far enough, punks.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.140
Pop?

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:21.266
"Pop"?

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.550
It's me.

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.311
Son?

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:25.894
Wait. Granddad?

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:27.726
No, it can't be.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.024
Damn, you look like shit.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.478
How could you look 20 years older
than my gray ass?

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:35.146
It's good to see your ass, too.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.985
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:40.029
Wow.

01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:42.661
You're my grandson?

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.116
I haven't been able to see you
since your daddy drove

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:48.012
your light-skinned ass
way the hell upstate.

01:31:48.795 --> 01:31:50.912
Only you could be a worse father
than I was.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:52.921
- You're a wonderful father...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:54.931
...after you stopped pretending
to be my uncle.

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:56.884
Wait. What?

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.364
Don't pay attention to him.

01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:01.347
Come over here
and give your granddaddy some love.

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:03.807
Y'all hungry?

01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:05.593
- Want some grits?
- Yeah.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.056
Grits? What's that?

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:09.805
It's a long story.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.210
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:12.350
What you need?

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:13.527
You still packing?

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:14.811
"Still packing."

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:17.321
Boy, back in the day,
we didn't need guns.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.482
All we needed was our bare knuckles.

01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:20.991
Ooh. Old school.

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:22.161
Okay.

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:25.746
Well, you can't be too prepared.

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:27.531
Oh, yeah.

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.371
What the hell?

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:32.713
Damn!

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.205
Grandpa!

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:37.216
Yo, what don't you have?

01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:42.091
So what's the gig?

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:47.560
Oh, drug kingpin, military scandal,
bad guys holding Junior's girl hostage.

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:49.015
You know, the usual.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.101
Usual shit, yeah.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.380
<i>You remember when your parents
used to help you with your homework?</i>

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:59.124
<i>You'd go to school the next day.
It all be wrong. Remember that shit?</i>

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:03.543
Thanks, Pops.
I'mma get this shit back to you.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.860
Now, wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:06.307
You think
I'm just gonna give you my shit

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:07.993
and let y'all have all the fun
without me?

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.453
Hell no. I'm coming with you.

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:12.753
You sure?

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.332
Damn right, I'm sure.

01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:16.042
I'm bored as hell up in here.

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:17.633
All right.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.216
Let's go get your girl.

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:21.047
Yeah, let's get Gordito's ass.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.876
I don't know, man.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:54.522
I do not like her just sitting there
without restraints on.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:56.287
Where the fuck's she gonna go, Cutty?

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:02.302
Hey!

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.655
You should take better care
of our guest.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:38.746
Can I help you, gentlemen?

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:42.587
Yeah, I was telling my boys here
that even at my age,

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.760
I could take you.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.341
Come on, pop.
Ain't you got something better to do?

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.159
Sound like to me
he calling you out, homes.

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:50.015
That is, unless you're scared.

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:51.517
Scared?

01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:52.644
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:54.887
Okay. Take your vitamins?

01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:57.268
You trying or what?

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.018
Where you going?

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:02.112
Huh?

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:06.074
Still got it.

01:35:07.076 --> 01:35:09.409
I bet if we were
wrestling for some french fries,

01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:10.579
he might've won.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.580
Not regular fries.

01:35:11.748 --> 01:35:13.910
For some chili cheese fries,
he'd kick your ass.

01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:15.369
Hey. We're in luck.

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:18.877
That penthouse is using the exact same
feed for the lobby and the elevator.

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:21.025
I'mma just go ahead and create a loop,
and I can use my phone.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:23.689
A loop? Is that where they don't see us
when we're on the elevator?

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:25.001
Exactly. See, you're learning.

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.694
That shit don't never work
in the movies.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:30.798
Is that motherfucker snoring?

01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:38.976
What's up?

01:35:43.863 --> 01:35:44.780
Mmm.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:46.613
Quality's perfect.

01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:53.529
As always, it has been a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:56.783
Transfer the funds.

01:36:06.552 --> 01:36:07.552
So they can't see us?

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.461
Oh, 100%.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:11.325
The only thing that they're gonna see
is the feed I uploaded.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:12.349
We're invisible.

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:14.258
Boy's got skills.

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:20.023
Uh-oh.

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:23.441
Does "uh-oh" mean
the movie shit's happening?

01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:27.358
Well, you know, without WiFi-

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.444
Do we have WiFi?

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:33.036
No.

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:34.615
So they can see us.

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.997
I mean, there's still a chance
that it's working.

01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.328
Hang on. Let me try something.

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:41.169
Sir.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.832
You should see this.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.131
Shaft?

01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:54.222
Cover the elevator! Watch the girl!

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:26.590
Yeah!

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.591
Oh.

01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:29.801
What the fuck?

01:37:38.478 --> 01:37:39.810
Don't you fucking move!

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:42.147
What are you doing?

01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:43.730
Oh, damn!

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:48.862
Get in here!

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:54.618
Oh, fuck!

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.034
Get in here, JJ!

01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:57.204
Come on!

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:11.675
These motherfuckers ain't playing.

01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:13.380
Gordito!

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.716
It's been so many years.

01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:18.850
No calls.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.009
No letters.

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:21.302
I miss you.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:38.577
Motherfucker!

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.197
- JJ!
- Sasha!

01:38:50.633 --> 01:38:51.840
Fuck!

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:00.265
Damn it!

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:04.804
You hit my girl?

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:11.481
Oh, shit!

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:21.872
Fuck!

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:24.949
You're out as well?

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:26.126
Yep.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.701
Mmm-hmm. I'll tell you what.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:31.463
Why don't we go old school?

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:44.513
Not bad, not bad.

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:46.974
Oh, so you wanna go there?

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:48.607
Let me get mine.

01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:53.480
You pussy.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:05.323
For my car, motherfucker.

01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:08.367
Check this out.

01:40:08.544 --> 01:40:10.022
Damn. You back here,
having a knife fight?

01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:11.046
Oh, hell no. I shot him.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:23.094
Hey. Hey.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.259
Say hi to Karim for me.

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:35.978
Motherfucker!

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:38.817
Like I said,

01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:40.527
boy's got skills.

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:41.908
Still hate guns.

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:45.163
Hey.

01:40:45.164 --> 01:40:46.164
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:47.290
Are you okay?

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.532
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:49.709
Are you bleeding?

01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:51.126
Nah, it's his blood.

01:40:51.837 --> 01:40:52.837
All right.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.621
Oh, my God.

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:56.506
Ooh. Come on.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.458
Ooh, shit.

01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:02.178
You all right?

01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:03.348
Yeah.

01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:05.466
Son of a bitch threw me into the table.

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.181
The fuck you laughing at?

01:41:09.355 --> 01:41:10.666
I'm laughing 'cause y'all thought

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.773
you were gonna do all this shit
by yourselves.

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:15.735
Shaft.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.362
Let's not do that.

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:34.287
Okay, you can point your gun at me.

01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:35.704
I'm the one you want.

01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:37.292
Is that what you think?

01:41:37.466 --> 01:41:38.547
It's what I know.

01:41:38.718 --> 01:41:42.132
I'm the cop that broke up
your little ghetto crack cartel

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:45.719
and sent your ass swirling
around the toilet for the last 20 years

01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:47.223
like the piece of shit you are.

01:41:47.393 --> 01:41:48.975
That was not because of you.

01:41:49.145 --> 01:41:50.761
Yeah, it was.

01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:54.815
Your assassination attempt only
succeeded in breaking up my family.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:56.771
That hit wasn't about you.

01:41:56.944 --> 01:42:01.905
I wanted to take away the one thing
you valued more than anything else.

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.118
Now, you're truly
about to lose everything.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.122
How do you feel?

01:42:17.089 --> 01:42:18.089
Aah!

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:55.496
I feel fine.

01:42:58.047 --> 01:42:59.047
Motherfucker.

01:43:05.554 --> 01:43:06.635
Dad!

01:43:07.264 --> 01:43:08.596
<i>Oh, what do I do? What do I do?</i>

01:43:08.766 --> 01:43:10.035
<i>Keep some pressure on it.</i>

01:43:10.059 --> 01:43:11.550
<i>Come on. Stay with us, Dad!</i>

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:13.593
<i>Don't die on me, Dad, please!</i>

01:43:18.317 --> 01:43:20.058
Is that you, Death?

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:23.191
Oh. Pop, hey.

01:43:23.906 --> 01:43:24.906
Shit.

01:43:25.074 --> 01:43:27.316
Don't be a pussy, son.

01:43:27.493 --> 01:43:28.574
What's that you say? What?

01:43:28.744 --> 01:43:30.451
You brought me some pussy?

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:31.621
Dang.

01:43:32.123 --> 01:43:34.285
I can't believe you actually
took a bullet for me.

01:43:36.544 --> 01:43:39.082
Shit was happening so fast. It's like...

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:41.797
No, and I tripped. It was an accident.

01:43:41.966 --> 01:43:44.549
Oh, yeah?
Is that how you remember it?

01:43:45.094 --> 01:43:46.926
Maya!

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:48.221
Oh.

01:43:49.473 --> 01:43:50.964
You did bring me some pussy.

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:54.228
Can you not refer to my mother
as "pussy," please?

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:56.345
Are you really gonna ruin this moment?

01:43:57.815 --> 01:43:59.101
Okay, look.

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:01.858
This motherfucker had Junior
dead to rights.

01:44:02.027 --> 01:44:06.397
I promised you I was
gonna take care of him, so I...

01:44:07.324 --> 01:44:08.324
Yeah.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:09.653
Now you gonna break me off?

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:11.661
Moment ruined.

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:13.036
How we feeling, Mr. Shaft?

01:44:13.205 --> 01:44:14.205
- Groovy.
- Great.

01:44:14.206 --> 01:44:15.206
I'm good.

01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:18.700
Sasha, can you please prescribe this man
something for his inflated ego?

01:44:20.171 --> 01:44:21.171
You did good.

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:23.872
I'm actually glad you were there.

01:44:29.513 --> 01:44:30.513
Talk to you later.

01:44:33.642 --> 01:44:34.974
Hey, Sash. Hang on.

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:37.344
I, uh...

01:44:40.733 --> 01:44:41.733
Kiss her.

01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:44.855
Go on, now.

01:44:54.872 --> 01:44:55.872
That's my boy.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.040
Our boy.

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:58.688
I pushed the little motherfucker out.

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.204
After I shot him in.

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:01.834
You always claiming shit.

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.001
Can I get one of those?

01:45:06.175 --> 01:45:08.258
No. I don't know where your lips been.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.136
<i>In other news,</i>

Nice work, John.

Yeah, I'm not coming back.

And the name is Shaft.

We got a call from a couple upstate.

Possible kidnapping and embezzlement.

01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:25.539
Can't call the cops.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:26.713
